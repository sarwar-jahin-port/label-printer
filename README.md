<h1>**Organic Label Printer**</h1> 

<h3>**Introduction:**</h3> It’s more of a personal project. The idea was to save time on some boring daily job. Every day this local business had to print their label for ordered products. It took 1-2 hours daily. Drag and drop on photoshop. Now, it’ s a matter of 5-10 mins work. Just put the order quantity of each SKU and labels are printed.

<h3>**What have I learned?**</h3>

It’s a whole new experience. Though it’s a very small project, still it’s my first project directly implemented in real life. 

<h3>**Difficulties I faced**</h3>

Only one problem was very challenging. In the right-side grid layout labels are producing unknown spaces. I failed to find why the spaces were producing. I tried chrome dev tool to figure out these spaces belong to which component but can’t find. I took my whole day. 

Interesting fact is after few days when I sat again to solve that problem. It took 5min to solve that issue. I just changed right-side height to fit content and boom. Solved! 

<h3>**Project Setup:**</h3> just fork and then clone the repo. yarn install and then yarn dev. Project will start running at your local host. 

<h3>**Summary:**</h3> Overall, it was fun.
